/**
 * 📌 Reels Data
 *
 * This file contains the list of reels that will appear in the website.
 *
 * 👉 How to use:
 * - Each reel is one object inside the `reels` array below.

 * - To remove a reel → just delete the object from the list.
 *
 * ⚠️ Important:
 * - Do not remove `aspectRatio`, `videoId`, `views`, or `platform` keys (they are required).

 * - If there is a testimonial → set `hasTestimonial: true` and fill in the testimonial fields.
 * - Images should be placed in `/public/images/testimonials/`.
 * - The `videoId` comes from Wistia (ask developer if unsure).
