## Here's what I've done:

I've been working on the site for the past few hours. Here's what I've done:

- Changed the color of the first section to black to see if it fits.

- Fixed all the issues that were present in the navigation bar, such as the logical order of the page and the word "Book Meeting" instead of "Let's Talk."

- Adjusted the logo size and the word "Performance Creative Partner" instead of the previous word.

- Significantly improved the site's responsiveness on other phones and adjusted the style so that all the words fit together, with no word far apart from the others.

- Made the image in the "My Services" section larger and clearer. Note that the image is very large (1,000 pixels or more), so this is the best thing I've achieved. If I made it larger, it would be a single image, with the rest below it, not side by side.

- Improved the "About Me" section to make it responsive on all screens, and also added grids to the background to make it stand out from the rest.

- Added social media links to the "About Me" section and the footer, but you still need to send me your contact information so I can add it to the site.

- Added the time in the footer to London time, making it clear second by second.

- Added the "Stack" section, under the "Workflow" section, as requested.

- Completely modified the "Our Principles" section to be like the example you send, changing the important words, and placing the title in the middle of the screen.

- I placed the "ATTITUDE" in the "About Me" section, but it was very poor, so I moved it under the stack, if you still want it under "About Me" section, I'll do it.

- Added the word "1 spot left" under the button in the footer.

- I fixed the autoplay on mobile, and it's working now, but you still need a good mobile device because many videos are playing simultaneously.

- Improved the site's speed in every way. If it's slow on some devices, this isn't due to programming at all. You'll need to upgrade your hosting, or make some videos not play automatically.

- You mentioned changing the navbar, but I find it really good. However, if you want to change it, like the image you sent, I'll do it.
