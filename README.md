## Here's what I've done:

I've been working on the site for the past few hours. Here's what I've done:

- Changed the color of the first section to black to see if it fits.

- Fixed all the issues that were present in the navigation bar, such as the logical order of the page and the word "Book Meeting" instead of "Let's Talk."

- Adjusted the logo size and the word "Performance Creative Partner" instead of the previous word.

- Significantly improved the site's responsiveness on other phones and adjusted the style so that all the words fit together, with no word far apart from the others.

- Made the image in the "My Services" section larger and clearer. Note that the image is very large (1,000 pixels or more), so this is the best thing I've achieved. If I made it larger, it would be a single image, with the rest below it, not side by side.

- Improved the "About Me" section to make it responsive on all screens, and also added grids to the background to make it stand out from the rest.

- Added social media links to the "About Me" section and the footer, but you still need to send me your contact information so I can add it to the site.

- Added the time in the footer to London time, making it clear second by second.

- Added the "Stack" section, under the "Workflow" section, as requested.

- Completely modified the "Our Principles" section to be like the example you send, changing the important words, and placing the title in the middle of the screen.

- I placed the "ATTITUDE" in the "About Me" section, but it was very poor, so I moved it under the stack, if you still want it under "About Me" section, I'll do it.

- Added the word "1 spot left" under the button in the footer.

- I fixed the autoplay on mobile, and it's working now, but you still need a good mobile device because many videos are playing simultaneously.

- Improved the site's speed in every way. If it's slow on some devices, this isn't due to programming at all. You'll need to upgrade your hosting, or make some videos not play automatically.

- You mentioned changing the navbar, but I find it really good. However, if you want to change it, like the image you sent, I'll do it.

### V2:

Here are the fixes I made to the site:

- Return "Let's talk" to the button on navigation bar.

- Changed the button in the footer to the new style as requested

- Fixed the time issue. (Now looks as expected)

- Fixed the padding in the "Services" section and fixed the mobile responsiveness issue

- The colors are blended throughout the site, so you won't notice any color standing out from the original color.

- I enlarged the images in the "My Services" section to make them clearer. I did this by making the container bigger, and that's the best I could come up with.

- Made the word "Performance Creative Partner" appear on mobile as well

- Added the scale to the "Our Process" section

- A comparison table section has been added above the FAQ, and it has been made fully responsive.

- Added new Twitter icon (X) instead of the old one.

## V3:

- All sections are now equal in height with no extra spacing between them.  
- The first three sections have been styled with a dark theme. (If approved, the rest will follow the same style).  
- Video is set to autoplay on desktop. (Note: Autoplay does not work on mobile due to browser restrictions).  
- Removed the default mute tag and implemented a custom mute/unmute button from scratch.  
- Wistia logo issue:
  - The free plan forces a non-removable logo.
  - As a workaround, the video has been slightly scaled to hide the logo without affecting quality.  
- Removed animations from the **Process** and **FAQ** sections.  
- Make website dark.

## In Progress
- Navbar improvements for smoother interaction.
- Add Google sheets API instead of Motion DB
